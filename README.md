## __Project Description__
We started by exploring the WHO suicide data and want to study the global suicide trends across time and what may influence the trends. 
We setteled on economy as the co-variate because of availability and quality of economic statistics over time on a global level. 
Inital hypothesis is that as economy suffered, the suicide count would increase.
