                <h2> What is this? </h2>
                <p> An exploration of suicide data from 1979 to 2016 in 128 countries, reported in the

                <h2> Which countries have the highest suicide rates? </h2>
                <p> Naturally, the first questions to ask are which country (or countries) have the 
                    highest suicide rates (SR), and whether they stay on top over time. A first glimpse reveals 
                    two countries with very high SR: Hungary and Lithuania. 
                    The majority of the other countries, however, cluster between 0 to 30 per 100 thousand
                    people.</p>

                </div>
                <p>To find out which other countries have high suicide rates, we tabulated the top 5 countries with
                    the highest SR from 1979 to 2016, then counted how many times each country appeared. </p>

                <p>Hungary ranked the highest in SR from 1979 to 1992. In 1993, Latvia rose to the top (SR=42.87),
                    with Lithuania as a close second (SR=42.69).
                    Starting from 1994 onwards, Lithuania remained on the top of the chart.</p>
                <p>The countries that most-frequently rank in the top 5 include (but are not limited to)
                    Lithuania, Hungary, Russia, Latvia, Estonia, Slovenia, and Belarus.
                    Only two East Asian countries made it to the list -- South Korea and Japan. 
                    South Korea appeared in the top 5 a total of 9 times across the years, compared to 
                    Japan, which only made it twice.</p>

                <h2>Suicide rates and economy</h2>
                <p>We are most interested in how changes in economic growth impact national suicide rates. 
                    Our hypothesis is that SR is negatively correlated with economic growth; 
                    that is, national SR decreaseS as an economy imporoves and vice versa. 
                    Four commonly used economic statistics were selected: 
                    GDP (per capita PPP constant in 2011 international $), 
                    unemployment rate, consumer price index, and Gini coefficient.

                </div>
                <p>When plotted against suicide rates, most of the economic indices show no apparent 
                    correlation to SR. Pearson's correlation coefficient is 0.05 between GDP and SR, 
                    -0.05 between consumer price index and SR, and -0.03 between unemployment rate and SR.
                    Curiously, Gini coefficient is the only economic index that shows a 
                    semi-moderate correlation with SR (r=-0.49). However,
                    the association appears to be counter-intuitive: as the Gini coefficient increases (that is, as
                    economic inequality increases), SR decreases. </p>
                    <p>Before too-rapidly attempting to make sense
                    of this correlation, we reviewed existing literature and found a mixed track record of Gini
                    coefficient and SR. 
                    Some studies

                    find higher inequality is correlated with higher rates of
                    suicide, while other studies <sup>

                    </sup>
                    find higher inequality is correlated to lower rates.
                    And sometimes, there is no correlation discernable<sup>

                    </sup>. 
                    It would appear, then, that there is no single economic indicator that maintains across all
                    countries. We need to instead examine the economy's impact on suicide rates
                    within subgroups of countries.

            <section class="crises">
                <h2>Suicide rates and crises</h2>
                <p>We selected crises with abrupt impacts on related countriesâ€™ economies, to confirm whether suicide rates change
                    in response to these transformations. We examined a political crisis (the dissolution of
                    the Soviet Union) and an economic crisis (the 1997 Asian financial crisis) to determine whether any economic
                    indicators were associated with SR changes.</p>
                <h3>The dissolution of the Soviet Union</h3>
                <p>To study the effect of the dissolution of the Soviet Union on SR trends, we compared SR in the 15
                    countries composing the USSR. Seven of them (Lithuania, Russia, Latvia, Belarus, 
                    Estonia, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine) display very similar patterns in SR across the years following the
                    dissolution of the USSR. Specifically, during 1991 to 1995 (that is, the five years including and immediately
                    following the dissolution) a similar jump in SR can be seen in all seven countries. Interestingly,
                    in the other eight countries, no such increase in SR is found across that time period.</p>
                <div class='oneplot'>
                    <iframe frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://plot.ly/~zoelzh/454.embed"></iframe>    
                </div>    
                <p>To return (now) national economies to the equation, GDP appears to be a rather reliable predictor of SR in the first
                    USSR cohort. As their economies suffered and GDP dropped from 1991 to 1995, SR increased significantly. 
                    After 1995, as GDP rebounded, SR steadily decreased.</p>
                <p>The relationship between SR and GDP is very different in the second USSR cohort, where
                 no dramatic increase in SR was observed during the 5 years following the dissolution of the USSR, even though 
                    GDP suffered in these countries as well. In general, too, SR in the second cohort are lower than that in the first cohort.</p>                
                <div class="scatmat">
                    <iframe frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://plot.ly/~zoelzh/456.embed" align="left"></iframe>
                </div>
                <div class="scatmat">
                    <iframe frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://plot.ly/~zoelzh/478.embed" align="right"></iframe>
                </div>

                <p>To quantify the association between SR and GDP, we calculated the correlation of GDP and SR in those
                    two cohorts and found strong, negative correlations in the first cohort. All but 2 countries
                    (Belarus and Kazakhstan) have a correlation coefficient of -0.88 or smaller. Even for Belarus and
                    Kazakhstan, the correlation coefficients are moderately strong.</p>
                <p>The correlations in the second cohort, however, are weaker and of mixed directions. Only two countries 
                    show an absolute correlation value larger than 0.5: Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. Tajikistan 
                    has a positive correlation of 0.65. Turkmenistan, the outlier in the 2nd cohort, has a moderately strong and 
                    negative correlation (-0.76), which is perhaps caused by large decrease in SR and a steady GDP growth 
                    starting from 2008 onwards.  
                </p>

                </div>
                <p>What do the seven countries have in common: what, if anything, made them suffer the same wave of high suicide rates
                    after the dissolution of the Soviet Union? What distinguishes them from the other eight countries?
                    Is it because they are countries that are immediately adjacent, geographically, to Russia? Or
                    perhaps these countries have a higher percentage of ethnic-Russian citizens, resulting in
                    dissolution being received as a bigger social blow to those residents? We donâ€™t have answers to
                    those questions. What we have learned, however, is that there is no one economic index that works across
                    the board for all 15 countries: but that one economic index may show a stronger impact in a subset of
                    countries than in others.</p>
                <h3>1997 Asia Financial Crisis</h3>
                <h3>Japan</h3>
                <p>Prior to the 1997 Asia Financial Crisis, a Japanese asset-price bubble collapsed in late 1991 and
                    early 1992. Suicide rates increased from 16.03 per 100k in 1991 to 16.82 in 1992.  
                    This, in turn, helps us put the impact of the 1997 Asian financial crisis in context. The
                    tremendous increase in suicide rates post Asian finanical crisis, 
                    from 18.64 in 1997 to 25.12 in 1998, dwarfs the previous increase in 1992. 
                    Among the four economic indicators, unemployment rate stands out -- and proves 
                    to be strongly associated with SR in Japan. The two rises in SR in the '90s were both coupled 
                    with rising unemployment rates.</p>
                <div class='oneplot'>
                    <iframe frameborder="0" scrolling="yes" src="https://plot.ly/~zoelzh/462.embed"></iframe>
                </div>
                <h3>Hong Kong</h3>
                <p>Similarly to Japan, Hong Kong suffered a sharp economic contraction during the 1997 Asian financial
                    crisis. SR in Hong Kong increased from 9.89 in 1997 to 12.94 in 1998, which was
                    accompanied by a rise in the unemployment rate. The next climb in SR, from 2000
                    to 2004, was once again shadowed by a large increase in unemployment.</p>
                <p>This strong association of suicide and unemployment rates appear to be a trend for both 
                    Japan and Hong Kong across the time span of 1979 to 2016.

                <h3>What about other countries impacted by the 1997 financial crisis?</h3>
                <p>An increase in SR and unemployment rates occured in South Korea and Thailand from 1997 to 1998, 
                    but not in Malaysia and the Philippines. More importantly, the unemployment rates in the above
                    four countries do not show a consistent and strong association with SR over time (as in 
                    Japan and Hong Kong.)</p>

                <p>Like the dissolution of Soviet Union, the financial crisis appears to have had a stronger SR impact on some
                    countries than on others. Unemployment rate is associated with SR in Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea,
                    and Thailand during that crisis, but not in Malaysia and Phillipines. </p>
                <p>Crises are like a magnifying glass. By examining SR during
                    political and economic crises, we were able to see how SR change with the economy in extreme cases.
                    Despite participation in supranational blocs, a given nationâ€™s SR does not always appear affected by
                    such memberships. Other trans-national factors may be at play.
                    If we cannot find the most efficient economic predictor for SR across the globe or regions, can we
                    find the most efficient economic predictor for each country?</p>
            </section>
            <section class='predictor'>
                <h2>Finding the strongest economic predictor for SR in each country</h2>
                <p>We used Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient to quantify the association between SR and GDP,
                    unemployment rate, consumer price index, and Gini coefficient. The maximum absolute value of the 
                    correlation coefficient is calculated to determine which economic statistic is the best predictor for SR in that country. </p>
                <div class='oneplot'>
                   <iframe frameborder="0" scrolling="yes" src="https://plot.ly/~zoelzh/476.embed"></iframe> 
                </div>
                <p>GDP and consumer price index appear to show strong association with
                more countries (43 and 42 repectively) than unemployment and Gini coefficient.
                This, however, should not be taken to mean GDP or consumer price index are better 
                economic predictors of SR, vis-a-vis unemployment rate or Gini coefficients. 
                If there is one takeaway, it should be this: When
                studying how suicide rates change on a national level, different aspects of the economy may differently impact 
                each country. There is no one single economic predictor that adequately fits them all.

                <p>To quote Tolstoy in <em>Anna Karenina</em> 
                    <sub>(who committed suicide in chapter 26!)</sub>,

                    While, broadly speaking, the economy does have an impact on SR,

                    The data contain 128 countries; 
                    <a href="http://apps.who.int/healthinfo/statistics/mortality/whodpms/help/faq.htm">not all countries were included</a>,  
                    as some countries did not report mortality data to WHO, while others
                    provided data not in standard ICD codes (and thus not included in the database.) 
                    Economic statistics (GDP, unemployment etc.) were extracted from 
                    the <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/">World Bank Open Data</a>. 
                    The analyses use nation as a unit without looking into SR of various
                    age or gender subgroups in order to study the impact of economy, which tend to be reported
                    on national levels, on suicide trends. </p>
